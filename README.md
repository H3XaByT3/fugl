# Fugl

Fugl ("bird" in Danish) is a [warrant canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) solution/system.
The project attempts to mitigate problems with existing canary solutions:

> We have seen canaries that are updated on a daily basis and canaries which are updated once per year.
> We have seen canaries that were created once and then never updated again.
> Again, the fact that canaries are non-standard makes it difficult to automatically monitor them for changes or takedowns.
>
> - EFF (Canary Watch â€“ One Year Later)

The goal is to provide canaries which are:

- Readable for humans
- Easy to parse for machines
- Simple to update and validate systematically

This allows users to automate the validation of canaries from hundreds of different companies, using a simple cron job.

## Canaries and proofs

Canaries are JSON structures, which are PGP (clear) signed producing what we call a "proof".

Here is an example of such a proof:

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

{
    "version": 0,
    "message": "",
    "previous": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
    "deadline": "2017-05-16T18:42:42+02:00",
    "nonce": "RZdfJucHRpqRqQWrnsgExwl34oHm7Xho"
}
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

=ZY0x
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
```

The `previous` field is a sha256 hash of the previous proof (or any hash for the initial proof).
The `deadline` field contains the latest time before which the next proof must be submitted. The format is still subject to change (suggestions are welcome)
The `message` field can be used to send a message to those verifying the proofs (a notification will be shown, when they verify the proof); if you fill this field, you should do so for a good reason.

Proofs are generated by the client (see cmd/client) and saved to a file.
This file can then be directly submitted to the server or moved across an air-gap and submitted from another machine.
The submission process is a simply HTTP post request (see next section).

## The server

The canary server is a simple self-contained HTTP server and does not rely on a database server.
All proofs are verified upon submission (using a specified public key) and saved in a directory on the server (sorted by deadline).
The server serves the proofs and the public key, allowing a client to start tracking the canary chain easily.

In addition the Fugl canary server can be used as digital [Dead man's switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man's_switch), by specifying an action (system command) which should be executed by the server if a canary has not been submitted before the next deadline.

Fugl was explicitly designed so that it does not rely on a single model of distribution. If you want to save and store the proofs on e.g. an FTP server this is also possible -- as long as clients know how to retrieve the proofs. The server is included to simplify automation.

## Getting started

You can start using Fugl, by first setting up a go environment, then:

```
~> git clone https://github.com/rot256/fugl
~> cd fugl/cmd/client
~> go get
~> go build
```

And use the same procedure for the server.

If there is interest I will provide pre-compiled binaries (but given the setting I would advise against it).

Further documentation in the making.

## Contributing

Fugl is still a work in progress (but close to being production ready),
if you want to contribute the best way to do so is by:

- Read the code (it is very short and quite readable)
- Provide suggestions for Canary format/API changes

Simplicity is prioritised over new features!

This repo WILL NOT contain an automatic system for tracking the canaries,
such a system should be easy to implement using the client (and I encourage people to do so).
